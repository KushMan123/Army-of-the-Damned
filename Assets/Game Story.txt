Your journey from Thraben to Shadowgrange has been
relatively safe and mercifully uneventful so far. The road
drifted across the rolling hills and heaths that make up the
landscape of province Gavony, taking you through small
villages and quiet farmlands.

A few days ago you entered Geier Reach, the imposing
mountain range that cuts Stensia off from its neighboring
provinces. The trail through it, called Kruin’s Pass, was a
long, jagged path that cut up and over the mountainsides,
until finally you entered Stensia proper. The last few
days had you trek through Stensia’s inner valley, passing
through the small settlements Silbern, Bourg, and Corsiva,
until earlier today when you crossed the threshold into the
outer valley via the Hofsaddel Pass.

The journey continues through Stensia’s outland valley
along winding stone paths dotted by grim pine trees
and flanked by the far-flung mountain ranges whose
boney peaks reach into the cloudy sky. Sprouting from
one such mountain is a castle with many spires, its
imposing structure casting a long shadow down from the
stony peaks. A hazey fog looms over the valleys, lightly
obscuring objects in the distance. The sky is awash in
warm orange-red, with dark purplish-red clouds covering
the setting sun.

3 swarms of skeletal bats are flying in
the your direction. They roam the road with the
singular motive of ripping apart any traveler unfortunate
enough to come across them. You think that starting a fight
may alert other mysteries around, but bat wings sell for a very good price.
You see a small roadside chapel whose name is long forgotten. You think that 
this may be a very good hiding space from the bats, but you worry about
what dangers may be lerking inside this abandoned space.

Option1: Fight the Skeletal Bats
Option2: Investigate the Chapel
