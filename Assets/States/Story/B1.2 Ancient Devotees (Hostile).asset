  storyText: "You draw out your sword and stab one of the skeletons freeing it from
    the pain and suffering. Your actions angered the remaining skeletons and started
    to attack you. \r\n\r\nYou start to regret your action. 3 vs 1 is not a very
    good spot to be in. But believing in yourself and all the training you have been
    put through all this life, you start counterattacking the attacks thrown at you.
    You try your best to dodge the swords and spells directed towards you but you
    are unsuccessful in completely dodging and parrying it. (Life -5). \r\n\r\nYou
    run across the room and shield yourself on the pillar from the enemy attack.
    You start to chant and charge your spell and add some holy energy to it. (Mana
    -5). After completion of the spell cast your spell and finally ending the battle."
