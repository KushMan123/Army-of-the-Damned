  storyText: "Anton is initially fearful of you but can be calmed down as you prove
    you aren\u2019t vampires or other monsters. You tell Anton that you are headed
    to Shadowgrange and he begs to come along, as the road is dangerous. He tells
    you that he\u2019s stopping by Shadowgrange to start a new life. He\u2019s also
    willing to provide any local knowledge about Stensia, basic information about
    important locations, rumors, dangers on the road.\r\n\r\nThe sun is about to
    set and it is still a long way to Shadowgrange. The road itself is very dangerous
    during the daytime. You can not imagine what might be the threat level during
    the nighttime. So you decided that it would continue the journey tomorrow. You
    feel that you could purify the Avacyn shrine with your holy magic. But this action
    comes with certain risks. If any monster were to attack, you could be in a vulnerable
    state, worse Anton could die. But if it was successful, you could have a good
    night's sleep feeling protected from monsters.\r"
  question: What will you do?
