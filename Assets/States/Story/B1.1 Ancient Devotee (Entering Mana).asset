  storyText: "You are inside the chapel. Silence fills the air and it is very unsettling
    feel an unholy presence within the chapel walls. You decide to investigate further
    down the corridor.\r\n\r\nWith Avacyn\u2019s presence fading from the world,
    foul magic has corrupted the earth's heart, and the dead have been forced to
    rise. Three figures geared in weathered leathers of Cathars sit on the rotted
    wooden pews with their heads bowed in reverence. Standing in front of them, at
    the far end of the chapel behind a dilapidated podium, is a skeleton garbed in
    tattered priestly robes, it's armed outstretched ceremoniously. \r\n\r\nThe skeletal
    priest notices you and gestures to join the service and sit."
  question: 'What will you do?
