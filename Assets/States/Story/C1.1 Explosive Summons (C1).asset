  storyText: "Wisps of black sulfurous smoke stream from the cave\u2019s mouth. The
    stone surfaces inside the cave are badly scorched from the fiery summoning. The
    cave is dimly lit by numerous wax candles littering the walls and floor, most
    knocked over from the explosion. Charred corpses of several cultists are on the
    floor, the palms of their hands ritually slashed open, their blood used to paint
    a wide red circle on the floor. The stone floor in the middle of the bloody circle
    has fallen through, now a gaping chasm that spews heat and sulfurous black smoke.
    The bottom of the chasm is lost in darkness.\r\n\r\nLeaping out of the chasm
    with a howl is a monstrous fiery hound, its razor-sharp claws and teeth crowned
    with flame. Riding atop this large dog is a small impish humanoid with long backswept
    horns and hard, chitin- like dark red skin. The fiend grins wide, revealing rows
    of needle-like teeth, its red eyes burning bright with anticipation as it yanks
    the iron reigns of its steed, urging it faster towards you.\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
