  storyText: "The journey continues through Stensia\u2019s outland valley along winding
    stone paths dotted by grim pine trees and flanked by the far-flung mountain ranges
    whose boney peaks reach into the cloudy sky. Sprouting from one such mountain
    is a castle with many spires, its imposing structure casting a long shadow down
    from the stony peaks. A hazy fog looms over the valleys, lightly obscuring objects
    in the distance. The sky is awash in warm orange-red, with dark purplish-red
    clouds covering the setting sun.\r\n\r\n3 swarms of skeletal bats are flying
    in your direction. They roam the road with the singular motive of ripping apart
    any traveler unfortunate enough to come across them. You think that starting
    a fight may alert other mysteries around, but bat wings sell for a very good
    price. You see a small roadside chapel whose name is long forgotten. You think
    that this may be a very good hiding space from the bats, but you worry about
    what dangers may be lurking inside this abandoned space.\r\n\r"
  question: What will you do?
