  storyText: 'You start to swing your sword hoping that the swarm will just move
    past you and you could continue your journey. You can feel the pain on your arms,
    shoulders, and legs. The bats had ripped off your armor and sucked your blood
    causing the pain. (Life -5) You go and find yourself of cover behind a cliff
    rock and start planning your next move.



    Your only move is to blast away
    past them. You shout the spell-trigger word, and a gout of flame erupts from
    your hand, engulfing the swarm. You can hear the high-pitched chirps, their pain
    burning in the flames and dropping to the ground. You see that the swarms of
    the bat had disappeared. Some of them lying on the ground scorched from the flames
    while others flee for their life.



    See all the rewards lying on the ground,
    you start to cut off the wings from the bat, hoping to exchange it for some gold.
