  storyText: "You hear a cascading sound of high-pitched chirps and screeches coming
    from somewhere up ahead. It\u2019s faint at first, but slowly rising in volume.
    There\u2019s a dark blotch in the mists in front of you, and now you can hear
    the screeching more clearly, along with the flapping of many tiny wings. The
    dark blotch grows and takes form \u2013 it\u2019s a cloud of skeletal bats!\r\n\r\nThe
    swarms attack any living beings in their way mercilessly with tiny razor-sharp
    bites and are headed towards you.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
