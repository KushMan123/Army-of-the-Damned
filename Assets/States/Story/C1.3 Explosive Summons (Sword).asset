  storyText: "You unsheathe your sword and prepare for the incoming attack. You block
    the attacks thrown at you and with a single mighty cleave per creature, you cut
    the beast emerged from the hell, one after another until each and every one of
    them lay on the ground.(Life -2)\n\nYou investigating the chasm find that the
    earth has resealed the bottom. No more demons will emerge from it -- at least
    until another summoning occurs. You see the bodies of the cultist lying on the
    ground, each being stabbed in the chest. Each cultist was ritually stabbed in
    the heart with a dagger with no signs of struggle, and the killing strokes were
    delivered hours before the ritual was completed. The ritual dagger is nowhere
    to be found. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you see two humanoid footprints exiting the
    cave. \r\n\n\r"
  question: What will you do?
