  storyText: "Anton tells that he is a good man but afraid to die. He begs you to
    help, swearing that he is faithful to Avacyn and doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone.
    He needs you to escort him to Shadowgrange where he can pick up supplies and
    escape north into the swamps, away from human civilization.\r\n\r\nYou decide
    to help him and let him continue this journey with you. But Anton decides to
    stay back and go to Shadowgrange on his own, as he is afraid that he could hurt
    you on tonight's full moon. As a thank you, Anoton gives you his Avacyn Collar.
    Anton could not wear it as blessed silver burns his flesh. You gladly take the
    collar and promised to come back to save him from his curse.\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
