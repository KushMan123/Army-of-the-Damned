  storyText: 'You decide to take a hostile approach and draw out your sword towards
    Anton. Anton for his safety, drew his own crossbow as his weapon started shooting
    at you.



    Anton''s shot didn''t come close to hitting you. You swung your
    sword and stabbed Anton on his heart ending his life. You feel very sad for doing
    this, but deep down you know that you have ended Anton''s suffering and you are
    keeping every other villager safe from the monster Anton would become in every
    full moon.



    You searched Anton''s body for anything valuable he was carrying.
    You found some gold (Gold +10 ) and an Avacyn Collar. Anton could never wear
    it  as blessed silver burns his flesh.  You put the collar inside your pocket
    as a memento and memory of Anton. You promised that you would go to Anton''s
    village and return this collar to his family.'
  question: What will you do?
