  storyText: "You search the cultist body. Each of the cultists is carrying some
    gold with them.  You are glad that you decided to investigate them. Gold, little
    they may be, could help you a long way in your journey. (Gold +20).\r\n\r\nOne
    of the cultists also carries a gilded ram\u2019s horn. It\u2019s worth 250 gold
    to the right (shady) buyer. Etched on its side is a symbol -- the symbol of the
    archdemon Griselbrand, the most venerated demon of the Skirsdag. You feel that
    there is more to the story than just a simple summoning ritual. So rather than
    exchanging for the gold that it's worth, you decided to keep hold of it.\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
