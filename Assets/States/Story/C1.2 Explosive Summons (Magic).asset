  storyText: "Judging from all the firey armor on the monsters, you think that casting
    Ice magic would be the best choice.\r\n\r\nWith an arcane word and a flourish
    of one hand, you send crystals of ice towards the monsters approaching. Your
    guess seems to be right on the target as you see the monsters lay on the ground
    from where they emerged. (Life -2)\n\nYou investigating the chasm find that the
    earth has resealed the bottom. No more demons will emerge from it -- at least
    until another summoning occurs. You see the bodies of the cultist lying on the
    ground, each being stabbed in the chest. Each cultist was ritually stabbed in
    the heart with a dagger with no signs of struggle, and the killing strokes were
    delivered hours before the ritual was completed. The ritual dagger is nowhere
    to be found. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you see two humanoid footprints exiting the
    cave. \r\n"
  question: What will you do?
