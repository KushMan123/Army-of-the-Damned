  storyText: "The shrine\u2019s divine magic lays dormant. You spend an hour performing
    the proper holy rituals to reactivate the divine magic. Doing so grants anyone
    rest at the shrine and evil creatures are compelled not to approach the shrine\u2019s
    immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nAfter the ritual, you are tired and decide to rest
    for the night. You talk with Anton about how dangerous life had become. Anton
    tells that he inherited land near Shadowgrange and that is why is traveling to
    sign the papers. After having a conversation for about an hour, you both decided
    to sleep and call it a night. You are glad that you performed the ritual. (You
    regained all the Life and Mana)\r\n\r"
  question: What will you do?
