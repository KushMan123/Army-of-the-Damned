  storyText: "The jagged stone road curves around a stony peak. As you round the
    bend, you see an alcove in the mountainside. In the middle of the alcove, bursting
    through the rocky ground is a wide pine tree stump. Carved from what usedto be
    its trunk and rising up from its stump is the symbol of the Church: Avacyn\u2019s
    Collar. Wildflowers, wooden trinkets, and prayer beads adorn the shrine. Before
    these shrines provided travelers a safe haven, its protective magics warded the
    immediate area from evil creatures. But with the archangel, Avacyn\u2019s disappearance,
    the holy magic of the shrine has gone dormant.\r\n\r\nKneeling in prayer in front
    of the shrine is a pale sweaty human wearing dirty, torn shepherd\u2019s clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
