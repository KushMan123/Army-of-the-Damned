  storyText: "The quiet valley is suddenly filled with a thunderous booming sound
    that rumbles through the earth. A chorus of otherworldly screams is heard off
    in the distance, an eerie cry of pain, horror, and celebration. Moments later,
    a large, dark humanoid figure emerges from the mountainside up ahead, taking
    to the air with broad, leathery wings. Black smokes streams up into the sky from
    where the figure emerged.\r\n\r\nShilgengar, the Demonlord of Ashmouth, emerges
    from the cave where the summoning ritual took place, 450 ft. away from the approaching
    adventurers. He hasn\u2019t seen you on the road and begins flying off north
    to Mauer Estate.\r\n\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
