  storyText: "Tucked between the road and the mountainside are the dilapidated remnants
    of a small chapel. The roof had caved in long ago, and the wood and stone foundation
    is half-covered in dirt and vegetation. Shards of colored glass from what once
    were stained glass windows litter the ground near the entrance. \r\n\r\nYou walk
    towards the entrance door and put some pressure to open it. It seems like the
    door is blocked from the other side and won't budge open. You start searching
    for another way in and find a small crack in the wall, big enough for you to
    fit and crawl inside. Unaware of the dangers that may be lurking inside, crawling
    inside through the wall may leave vulnerable to enemy attacks if there are any.
    You could just fire through the front entrance with your handy spells and be
    ready for attacks.\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
