  storyText: "Your journey from Thraben to Shadowgrange has been relatively safe
    and mercifully uneventful so far. The road drifted across the rolling hills and
    heaths that make up the landscape of province Gavony, taking you through small
    villages and quiet farmlands.\r\n\r\nA few days ago you entered Geier Reach,
    the imposing mountain range that cuts Stensia off from its neighboring provinces.
    The trail through it, called Kruin\u2019s Pass, was a long, jagged path that
    cut up and over the mountainsides until finally, you entered Stensia proper.
    The last few days had you trek through Stensia\u2019s inner valley, passing through
    the small settlements Silbern, Bourg, and Corsiva, until earlier today when you
    crossed the threshold into the outer valley via the Hofsaddel Pass.\r\n"
  question: 'What will you do?
