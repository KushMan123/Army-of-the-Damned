  storyText: 'With an arcane word and a flourish of one hand, you send a bolt of
    fire into the cloud of swarms. You see bats drop of the ground thrashing in the
    flames. But the swarms do not seem to go away. You go and find yourself of cover
    behind a cliff rock and start planning your next move.



    Your only move
    is to blast away past them. You shout the spell-trigger word, and a gout of flame
    erupts from your hand, engulfing the swarm. You can hear the high-pitched chirps,
    their pain burning in the flames and dropping to the ground. You see that the
    swarms of the bat had disappeared. Some of them lying on the ground scorched
    from the flames while others flee for their life.



    See all the rewards
    lying on the ground, you start to cut off the wings from the bat, hoping to exchange
    it for some gold. (Gold +20)
