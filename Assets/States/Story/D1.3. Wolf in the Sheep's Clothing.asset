  storyText: "You are tired and decide to rest for the night. You talk with Anton
    about how dangerous life had become. Anton tells that he inherited land near
    Shadowgrange and that is why is traveling to sign the papers. After having a
    conversation for about an hour, you both decided to sleep and call it a night.
    \r\n\r\nYou decided to stay watch as Anton headed for bed. You hoped that you
    had reactivated the shrine so you could sleep peacefully. You started to think
    where this journey would take you and whether you would get to see the end of
    this journey or not and slowly, drifted to sleep. \r\n\r\nContinue"
