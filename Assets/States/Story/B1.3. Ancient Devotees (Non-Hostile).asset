  storyText: "You join the service and sit among the skeletal priests. The ceremony
    continues for some time and you are sitting there thinking of some reasonable
    idea to put the priests at rest.\r\n\r\nCasting a holy spell is the only way
    to do it. You start to chant and charge your spell and add some holy energy to
    it. (Mana -3). A white light shines covering the whole room. After the spell
    has completely been cast, the skeletons collapse, and spectral images of their
    former living selves briefly appear, thank you, and reward you with the tithe
    bowl before fading away.  (Gold +70). \r\n\r\n\n\r\n"
  question: What will you do?
