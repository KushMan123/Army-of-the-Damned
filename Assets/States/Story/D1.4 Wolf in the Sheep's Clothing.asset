  storyText: "The next morning, both you and Anton continue your journey towards
    Shadowgrange. Anton is a commoner and carries a light crossbow to protect himself.
    \r\n\r\nYou notice a burn mark in the shape of Avacyn's Collor on Anton's wrist.
    He hides the burn mark under his sleeve. You ask him about the mark, Anton nervously
    answers that it was just some wound he got while fighting the monster's back.
    But you were sure there was more to the story and confronted him with your sword.
    Anton scared for his life tells the truth. A few nights ago Anton was bitten
    by a werewolf and cursed with lycanthropy. Fearing for the safety of his loved
    ones, he left his home and is making the trek to Shadowgrange, hoping to pick
    up supplies there and then continue on to the far bog to live in isolation. Anton
    has been praying to Avacyn hoping not to let the curse take hold, but unknown
    to him, tomorrow night is a full moon, which will cause him to involuntarily
    transform into a werewolf. \r\n"
  question: After hearing the dark secret, What will you do?
